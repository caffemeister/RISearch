There's a 5$ registration fee to upload extensions into the chrome store, so instead of doing that I'll just post the extension here and install it unpacked.

To install and use:
1. Download/clone the repo to a local directory
2. Open up a chrome-based browser, go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable developer mode in the top-right
4. Click on `Load unpacked` in the top-left, and select the directory where you cloned this repo
